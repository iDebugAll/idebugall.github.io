### Hi there 👋

I'm a seasoned technical leader with over a decade of experience in enterprise IT, specializing in driving innovation and delivering strategic outcomes. Recognized as a Cisco Champion (2021-2022) and a UAE Golden Visa holder for Specialized Talent, I’ve successfully led teams and initiatives across key domains:

* 🤖 NetDevOps and Automation
* 🕸 Networks
* 🛠 IT Infrastructure
* ☎️ Unified Communications & Collaboration

</br>
Fluent in both Tech and Corp Speak, I excel at bridging technical innovation with organizational priorities to deliver impactful results. I prioritize collaboration, effective communication, and strategic thinking to drive successful outcomes. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, surfing, continuous learning, and sharing knowledge with the community.</br>
